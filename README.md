# Data Scientist Technical Test

### Introduction

Welcome to Nubalū technical test for Data Scientist position. The purpose of this test is both evaluate your programming skills and engineering vision according to our offer posted [here](https://nubalu.io/jobs/data-scientist).

So, main responsibilities of this position are:

1. Explore and analyze datasets and prepare it to machine learning processes.
2. Invest the problem to solve in order to choose those models that better fit with it and request additional data to data engineers team if needed.
3. Train and test the different models, comparing between them in order to choose the best setup.
4. Document and make those models available for automated/schedule executions.

According to our data stack, we use Python3 as main coding language running over AWS.

### Description

As we said, the purpose of this test is evaluate your technical skills, so we have raised a simple ML problem which shouldn't take you more than **1-2 hours** to solve, so we understand non top quality code ;)

You have to choose and train a model to predict Spanish Property Price Index (PPI), using the given **dataset.csv** which contains chronologically sorted data since 2007 that is quarterly published at [INE](https://www.ine.es/dyngs/INEbase/listaoperaciones.htm). Each sample has seven features, last one is the output feature (PPI), the rest are inputs:

- Property transactions
- Mortgages amount
- Consumer price index
- Gross income
- Unemployment rate
- Construction workers

Build some Python3 script using libraries like `pandas`,  `sklearn` or similar to solve that, and make available both `.py  `  script and some `.md` or `.pdf` document showing your results (Loss graph, RMSE...)  on any personal repository, Dropbox or similar collaborative tools.

**Bonus**:  Propose some dataset or model change that could improve significantly your results.

If you have any doubt, please feel free to contact us at jobs@nubalu.io.



Best regards.
